## Cryptanalysis of the Vigenere Cipher

The Vigenere cipher was though to be completely unbreakable for hundreds of years, and indeed, if very long keys are used the vigenere cipher can be unbreakable. But if short keys are used, or if we have a lot of ciphertext compared to the key length, the vigenere cipher is quite solvable.
